  - Rarity (Low, High, Special, N/A)

- CONSUMEABLE:
  - Instead of applying the effect while in use, the effect would be directly applied to the character and the item removed
  
- PERMENANT EFFECTS:
  - Instead of just being a statbuff, the effect would immediately apply the stat change permenantly on use. This would effect base levels of the stats

- EVENTS:

  - An item/ability/effect could respond to a certain set of events
  - For example an item could have: remove_on = 'turn' which would remove the effect when the users turn is over
  - It could also have a counter so something like: remove_on = 'turn 2' would remove it after 2 turns

- Add the ability to effect all
